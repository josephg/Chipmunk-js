# Chipmunk for Javascript!

This is a port of the [Chipmunk Physics](http://chipmunk-physics.net/) library to Javascript!

## Caveats

- It is slower than the C version (duh, its in javascript). Specifically, physics simulations using chipmunk-js runs about 3 times slower than the C equivalent.
- I haven't implemented chipmunk's spatial hash, and I have no intention to do so.

# Usage

The API for Chipmunk-js is almost identical to chipmunk-physics. Except:

- The `cp` prefix has gone
- Most functions are wrapped by their containing objects
- Some functions took an array-and-length. Arrays are now all simply javascript arrays, and the length argument has been removed. Eg:

    ```c
cpMomentForPoly(mass, numVerts, *verts, offset);
    ```

    is now simply:

    ```javascript
momentForPoly(mass, verts, offset);
    ```

- Lots of trivial getters and setters have been removed. Access the property directly.

## On a website

```html
<script src="cp.min.js"></script>

<script>
var space = new cp.Space();
space.addBody(new cp.Body(...))
// ...
</script>
```

If any exceptions are thrown or anything, use `cp.js` instead and post the stack trace you get to the issue page.

## From nodejs

`npm install chipmunk`

```javascript
cp = require('chipmunk');

var space = new cp.Space();
space.addBody(new cp.Body(...))
// ...
```

# Example

This code creates a new space, sets 10 physics iterations per update (these increase simulation stability). Then it adds a bunch of line segments to the space.

In C, this code looked like:

```C
  cpSpace *space = cpSpaceNew();
  space->iterations = 10;
  
  cpVect offset = cpv(-320, -240);
  for(int i=0; i<(bouncy_terrain_count - 1); i++){
    cpVect a = bouncy_terrain_verts[i], b = bouncy_terrain_verts[i+1];
    cpShape *shape = cpSpaceAddShape(space, cpSegmentShapeNew(cpSpaceGetStaticBody(space), cpvadd(a, offset), cpvadd(b, offset), 0.0f));
    cpShapeSetElasticity(shape, 1.0f);
  }
```

In javascript, the equivalent code is:

```javascript
  var space = new cp.Space();
  space.iterations = 10;
  
  var offset = cp.v(-320, -240);
  for(var i=0; i<(bouncy_terrain_verts.length - 1); i++){
    var a = bouncy_terrain_verts[i], b = bouncy_terrain_verts[i+1];
    var shape = space.addShape(new cp.SegmentShape(space.staticBody, cp.vadd(a, offset), cp.vadd(b, offset), 0));
    shape.setElasticity(1);
  }
```
